# TypeScript Course Completion

This repository contains my work from completing a TypeScript course. The course covered the following topics:

- **Types**: Deep dive into TypeScript's type system, including custom types and type inference.
- **Generics**: Leveraging generics for flexible, reusable code.
- **Functions**: Type-safe functions, parameter annotations, and return types.
- **Error Handling**: Structured error handling techniques for TypeScript.
- **Design Patterns**: Applying design patterns within TypeScript for cleaner code architecture.
- **Decorators**: Using decorators to add metadata and enhance functionality in classes and methods.
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Understanding TypeScript's approach to object-oriented programming.
- **TypeScript Setup**: Setting up a TypeScript environment with best practices.

## Final Project: Weather App

The course concluded with a final project—a mini weather application built with TypeScript. This app allows users to search for a city and view:

- **Current Weather**: Shows the latest weather details for the searched city.
- **5-Day Forecast**: Displays forecast data for the next five days.

The app integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information.

### Setup

To run this project, you’ll need to set up an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanioFiore/typescript_exercises.git

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

3. Add your own api key in weather.ts

4. Build the application
    ```bash
    npm run build

5. Run your own server (live server with vscode)
